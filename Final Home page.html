	<h2>What is a Kage</h2>

	<p>A Kage (影; Literally meaning "Shadow") is the leader of one of
		the five most powerful hidden villages and are generally acknowledged
		as the most powerful ninja in their respective villages. They are
		collectively known as the Five Kage (五影, Gokage; Literally meaning
		"Five Shadows")</p>

	<p>A Kage may retire and give the title to someone else; the title,
		once granted, is held permanently. This creates a case where there
		are two Kages at the same time, with only one of them actually
		active, as was with the Fourth and Third Hokage, where the latter
		had given up the title to the former, only to come out of retirement
		when the former died.</p>

	<p>The Kage stand equally with the rulers of their countries,
		oversee the activities of their villages, and are the leaders of
		ninja society. They typically are the ones who send the ninja teams
		out on their missions and make the decisions regarding the safety
		of the village.</p>
