		<h1>The Kazekages</h1>

			<p>The Kazekage (風影, Literally meaning: Wind Shadow) is the 
			Kage of Sunagakure, a title bestowed on the village's leader. 
			The Kazekage is generally regarded as the strongest shinobi in 
			the village. There have been five Kazekage in the village's 
			history.</p>

			<p>The Kazekage position was created after the formation of 
			Suna by Reto, the village's founder, that in anime was the last
			of the five Kage to emerge. Although it is not expressly 
			stated how a candidate for office is selected, in Gaara Hiden 
			suggests that the Kazekage position is hereditary, or at least 
			that relatives of the Fourth Kazekage are most suitable for the 
			position; this lineage is referred to as the "Kazekage Clan". 
			If the occupant of the post die or reported missing after a 
			long period of time, the next Kazekage is chosen by the Suna 
			Council. Once the duties of the position are assumed, they 
			usually move to the Kazekage's Office.</p>

			<p>Throughout history, the Kazekage have earned a reputation 
			for being feared and respected around the world, due be 
			responsible for keeping Suna on an even footing with the 
			other villages despite its small size. However, the Kazekage 
			title is sometimes considered cursed, as all the Kazekage, 
			ncluding the current, have met untimely deaths at the hands 
			of assassins; the village's affairs are decided by the 
			Suna Council in the interim between Kazekage. Full-bodied 
			statues of all the former Kazekage are kept in council's 
			meeting chambers.</p>
