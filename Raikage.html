		<h1>The Raikages</h1>
			<img src="Raikages.jpg"/> 
			<p>The Raikage (雷影, Literally meaning: Lightning Shadow) is 
			the Kage of Kumogakure, a title bestowed on the village's 
			leader. The Raikage is generally regarded as the strongest 
			shinobi in the village. There have been five Raikage in the 
			village's history.</p>
			<img src="A.jfif"/>(Founder of Kumogakure)
			
			<p>The Raikage position was created after the formation of Kumo 
			by A, the village's founder, that in anime was the second of 
			the five Kage to emerge. How the Raikage is selected 
			isn't clear; The Second was appointed for his long service 
			and dedication as the bodyguard of the First Raikage
			and after the Third died, his son automatically became Fourth 
			Raikage, a decision made many years earlier. Generally, the 
			Raikage is known for its strong desire to protect the village 
			and its inhabitants as well as for its pride. The Raikage 
			works inside a central blue structure inside Kumogakure.</p>

			<p>Throughout Kumo's history, the first four Raikage each had the given 
			name A (エー, Ē, Viz: Ei, English TV: Ay). Each A had a tag-team partner 
			named "B" (ビー, Bī), who was responsible for defending the Raikage and 
			bringing out the Raikage's full power.</p>
