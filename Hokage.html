		<h1>The Hokages</h1>
			<img src="Hokages.jpg"/> 
			(The Hokages throughout the generations)
			
			<p>The Hokage (火影, Literally meaning: Fire Shadow) is the 
			Kage of Konohagakure, a title bestowed on the village's leader.
			The Hokage is generally regarded as the strongest shinobi in the
			village. There have been seven Hokage in the village's history.</p>

			(Madara and Hashirama "Founders of Konohagakure")
			
			<p>The Hokage position was created shortly after the creation of
			Konoha by Hashirama Senju, one of the village's founders. He 
			intended the title to be given to his co-founder, Madara Uchiha,
			but the village's population instead selected Hashirama as the 
			First Hokage. Madara feared that Hashirama's selection was the 
			first step in making the Hokage office an extension of the Senju 
			clan's authority, a fear Hashirama denied. Despite this, all 
			of the village's Hokage have traced back to Hashirama in some 
			way: the Second was his brother; the Third was a student of both
			his brother and himself; the Fourth was a student of one of the 
			Third's students; the Fifth is his granddaughter and another 
			student of the Third; the Sixth was a student of the Fourth; the
			Seventh is a student of the Sixth and the son of the Fourth.</p>

			<p>The Hokage typically selects their successor. If they die 
			or are otherwise incapacitated, the next Hokage is instead 
			chosen by the daimyō of the Land of Fire with the advice of 
			his committee, the Konoha Council, the Jōnin Commander and a 
			representative of the Anbu. This choice must then be approved
			by Konoha's jōnin. If one of the Hokage's predecessors is 
			still alive, they may return to office rather than select a 
			new Hokage, as when the Third came out of retirement following
			the Fourth's death. The Hokage's inauguration is a major event
			in Konoha, with most of the village attending. The new Hokage
			is granted a ceremonial haori on the occasion; the same woman
			has embroidered the haori for all seven Hokage.[2] Once they 
			assume the duties of Hokage, their face is carved into the 
			Hokage Rock and they usually move in to the Hokage Residence.
			The Hokage's office is located in the administrative section 
			of the Academy.</p>

			<p>Eventually Madara turned on the leaf and tried to destory 
			it beliveing that it had seperated him from his own clan and 
			that futher down the line the uchiha would suffer. Time would
			prove hime right as the second Hokage was made to be Tobirama
			Senju who had a prejudice against the Uchiha and began to 
			ostracized the clan outside of the village.</p>
